# Arithmetic_Expression_Evaluator
 - To evaluate the arithmetic expression
 - (inputs string and returns int() on success and None on failure)
 - Did the assignment on Python 3.12.3 using the inbuilt default python unittest framework
 - To execute the test, please do run -  python -m unittest arithmetic_exp.py -v
 - I have made some assumptions in the test outcome which I have explained in the testcases in the .py file
 - I limited to one level nested parantheses and one level of recursion, due to lack of time. This is the area I would like to test more.
